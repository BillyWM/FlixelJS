Direct port of Flixel from AS3 to Javascript (HTML5/Canvas)

I started this project a few months ago and haven't yet completed it (that last 10% is a killer!) but it's been stagnating too long, so I'm releasing what I have to the world, and perhaps someone can fix it up before I do ;)

I initially converted by hand from AS3 to Javascript

Unfortunately it's currently broken and incomplete in a few ways:

- Collision completely broken :(
- Transparency problems
- A few minor classes not yet converted
- Asset loading system not added (was waiting til I got the library working)
- Tilemap issue (it draws a little notch on tilemaps for some reason)
